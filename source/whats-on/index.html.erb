      <h1>Something missing?</h1>
      Have we missed your event or gathering? Let everyone know now via <a href="http://theskiff.groupbuzz.io">Groupbuzz</a>. Make sure you tell us at least a week before the next time it comes up via hello@theskiff.org. We'll be sending these round ups every Monday (usually first thing in the morning).<br />
      <br />
      Have a great week!<br />
      <br />

      PS If you'd like to volunteer to be Captain let me know and I'll share more with you about what's involved. We need someone for the weeks commencing 4th and 18th December.
