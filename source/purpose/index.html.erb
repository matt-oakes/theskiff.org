      <p>The Skiff is a community above all else. Many of our 200 members started forming our community over decade ago, years before we even had a space. In the unlikely event that our building became unavailable, the community would find a way to continue supporting each other.</p>

      <p>We’re all in this together as members. The Skiff is your community and your workspace it exists to support you and adapt to your needs. You have the freedom to make it your own.</p>

      <p>We’re free to choose our path. No one depends on The Skiff for financial gain. We don’t have any full-time employees or directors. And we’re not dependent on external investment, grant funding, sponsorship or donations. Success for us all is being able to continue supporting each other and our respective businesses.</p>
